> Sound is one of the main components of the physical world.
> Scientifically, it is a mechanical disturbance propagating in an elastic material environment. 
> We are capable of perceiving and interpreting these disturbances. 
> It is even one of our most solicited senses, and we associate objects, atmospheres or even feelings with it. 
> We have created the web app **Wavy**. The app allows users to explore the nuances and technicalities of noise, 
> sound and music while being creative and interacting with the audio file recordings of different instruments.


> 
> Wavy gives you access to our large database of instrument recordings.
> You can choose to visualise the sounds both in the time and frequency spectrum,
> and visualise how the waves change from one note to another.

> To access all the sound recordings you must make an account. This should only take you a minute.
> If you are not sure you want an account, you can simply try Demo. 
> The demo plot is the same as the full access plot, but you are limited to 
> the flute.

> As part of the Wavy community, you can access our forum.
> In the forum you can share your thoughts about your findings, or anything you like really.
> You can also share images with the community, so that people can see your plots.
